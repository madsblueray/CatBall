Hi there! Welcome to my Catball git repository.

Not much that's pretty to look at. If you just want to take a peek at my code go right ahead! Everything of importance is under /Assets/Scripts.

I didn't clean up most of my code to make it pretty to read because this was my first proper, script-heavy undertaking and I was learning as I went. I created this weird "bootstrapper" system to initialize objects in a specialized priorty order. Little did I know you can just set this manually for every script in Unity settings... I decided to keep it anyways because, why not? It's not slow and only takes up runtime before the game starts.

That's about it, the rest is mostly math or data structures. Oh, and a lot of events. Cheers!
